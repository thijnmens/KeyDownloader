# KeyDownloader
Downloads songs from beatsaver.com by key.

# Instalation
Make sure you have the latest version of python installed, toghether with ModAssistant. also make sure that BeatList is NOT installed.
Then download the repository here https://github.com/thijnmens/KeyDownloader/archive/main.zip and unzip it.

# Run the script
To run the script, go to Modassistant and then the Settings tab, click the "Enable OneClickâ„¢ Installs" button and check the BeatSaver checkbox.
then change "Show OneClick Installer Window" is set to "Close" or "No", when first running the program i reccomend setting it to "Close". 
Once you verified that it works (you know that it works when a window pops up with the modassistant logo when running the program), set it to "No".

then open a command promt window, you can find this by typing in "cmd" into the windows search bar.
then you run the following commands:
  `CD <path>`, you replace `<path>` with the path to the download location of the script.
  `python keydownloader.py` this will initiate the script.
  now the program will ask you for some values:
    the first value is the first key that should be downloaded in decimal numbers.
    the second value is the delay between downloads, please keep this at the default value.
    the third value is the last key that should be downloaded in decimal numbers.
    the fourth value is really handy if you want to start with all the latest songs instead of all those ppv1 songs.
  after this the downloads will start and you are done!
